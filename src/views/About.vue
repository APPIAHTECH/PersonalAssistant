    <h1>My project proposal is to build a question-answer system.</h1>
    <h1>The idea is to build a small version of Cortana. I want to build a system that given a reference context text (paragraph) and a question it returns the answer within the paragraph. </h1>
    <br>
    <h1>
        Example:

        Paragraph = "A study by the World Institute for Development Economics Research at United Nations University reports that the richest 1% of adults alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000. The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. "
    </h1>
    <br>
    <h1>
        Question = What percentage of global assets does the richest 1% of people have?

        Answer = 40%
